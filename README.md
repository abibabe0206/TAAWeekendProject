# Descriptions
 * This project is a small application used for traveling.  
 The project is made of Four parts:  
 * The Back end section ([Java -Spring Boot, and JAP](https://www.javainuse.com/spring/boot-jwt-mysql)).
 * The Front end section ([Angular 8](https://angular.io)).
 * The database in phpAdmin running on [Docker](https://blog.thenets.org/how-to-install-mysql-and-phpmyadmin-with-docker/).
 * The Swagger section [Swagger](http://localhost:9002/swagger-ui.html#/), used in viewing all the application API. This can only be seen one the application is running.
